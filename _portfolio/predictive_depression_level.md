title: "Predictive Depression Level"
excerpt: "When a patient is diagnosed with depression of any level the next step is a type of treatment or multiple treatments. These treatments can consist of therapy, medication, meditation, changes in daily routines etc. The treatments can be done at different levels, for therapy it’s how often, for medication it’s the dosage, etc.. Often discussion of how treatment is going is based on patient answers at a check-in. The issue with this is that at that single point in time the patient can misrepresent their answers due to what mode they are in that day, not sure what to measure, or misremembering information. To assess if the treatment is having effect on the patient’s level of depression data validity is important. The point of this project is to help assess depression levels throughout treatment and gauge progress by using the same measurements on a daily basis which can be used by the patient’s therapist and/or doctor to aid in treatment decisions."
