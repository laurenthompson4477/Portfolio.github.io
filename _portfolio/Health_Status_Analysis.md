title: "Health Status Analysis"
excerpt: "This project came about due to the increase of illness in the United states. Outbreaks of new viruses such as COVID-19 will never be predictable but common diseases that have an established history do have some predictability. This project’s goal is to explore the health status of the countries. This project will investigate the health status of countries in attempts to identify an individual’s likelihood of various health outcomes based on location, age, and gender. This study could be used to apply to statistics to an individual or a country at whole to help identify where more preventative care is needed."
