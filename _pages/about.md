I am a passionate and driven software engineer with 6 years of experience in software engineering and 4 years of experience in data science. My journey in software development began when I took computer science 101 in college. I was captivated by the art of problem solving through software development. Being about to take a real-world problem and brainstorm technical solutions sparked an interest in furthering my studies in computer science. 

After years of producing applications through software engineering, I noticed a   wave of data in the STEM field. For years companies have been collecting data and now technology has advanced with the capability of being able to analyze that data and use it to predict future outcomes. This led me to transfer to a data science project at work using data to predict attrition rates which would result in the company’s hiring goals. This also led me to purse my master’s degree in data science.
